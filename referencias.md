Physics in a diverse world or A Spherical Cow Model of Physics Talent
Howard Georgi

Fragmento:

"I suspect that many of you, when you think about diversity in physics feel as I did for much
of my life. We say to ourselves something like “I am a good person and I would like to
increase diversity in physics but we face societal obstacles not of our own making and there
is nothing I can do.”
I don’t want this talk to sound judgmental and I certainly don’t want to hold myself up
as a role model. In fact, I am very embarrassed that it took me almost 45 years to realize
that assuming there is nothing I can do is both morally untenable and very bad for physics.
For me, the epiphany came when I was chairman of the Harvard Physics Department in 1992
and it had to do with gender diversity. By this time I had been teaching at Harvard for over
15 years and I was very spoiled."
